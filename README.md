# Real-Time Data Streaming with Spring Boot and Kafka

This project is a robust implementation of a real-time data streaming system built using **Spring Boot** and **Apache Kafka**. It handles live streaming data from a website, processes it in real time, and consumes it using a Kafka consumer.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Ingests live data from a website and publishes it to a Kafka topic.
- **Kafka Consumer**: Consumes streaming data for further processing or storage.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for scalability and fault tolerance using Kafkaâ€™s distributed messaging system.
- **Configurable**: Easy to configure Kafka properties (e.g., brokers, topics, and consumer groups).

## Prerequisites
- **Java 11+**
- **Apache Kafka** (installed and running)
- **Maven** for building the project
