**Real-Time Data Streaming with Spring Boot and Kafka**

This project is a robust implementation of a real-time data streaming system built using Spring Boot and Apache Kafka. It handles live streaming data from a website, processes it in real time, and consumes it using a Kafka consumer.

**Features**

1. Real-Time Data Streaming: Ingests live data from a website and publishes it to a Kafka topic.
2. Kafka Consumer: Consumes streaming data for further processing or storage.
3. Scalable Architecture: Designed for scalability and fault tolerance using Kafkaâ€™s distributed messaging system.
4. Configurable: Easy to configure Kafka properties (e.g., brokers, topics, and consumer groups).

**Prerequisites**
1. Java 11+
2. Apache Kafka (installed and running)
